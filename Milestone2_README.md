# Data organization
Our data is analyzed in the notebook Milestone_2.ipynb.

# Initial research questions
As stated in the Milestone 1, in this milestone we tried to analyze and answer the following questions:
- Are the resources produced by agriculture equally distributed among the workers or is there a strong bias in favour of companies?
- Based on the CO2 emission and the use of pesticides, what is the environmental impact of agriculture on the producing countries and on the importing countries?
- What are the consequences of the agriculture industry on the availability of natural and energetic resources?
- What are the differences among nations and products? Is there any similar pattern in the poor and rich nations?
- Once all these questions have been answered, could any of these issues be a possible concurrent cause for world hunger? How could these be possibly solved?
