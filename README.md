# Title
Climate Change and Global Inequalities: in-depth analysis of FAO database.

# Abstract
Wealth inequality, global warming and natural resources exploitation are some of the most discussed issues of the last decades. In our project we want to assess the influence that agriculture and livestock farming have on these different topics and how these problems could be solved.  
The effect of agriculture will be evaluated by measuring the produced carbon dioxide, the use of pesticides, whether resources are equally distributed on the production chain and eventually how these affect the availability of natural resources. Both the influence of single products and single countries on these matters will be assessed. This will provide us insights on what nations play a key role in accumulating the agriculture-originated wealth of third countries. Hence, we will evaluate nations reciprocal influence. We will also try to comprehend how all these factors can be correlated to the world hunger and how the UN could try to alleviate the issue.

# Research questions
In the following, we will try to provide answers to these questions and detect the causes:
- Are the resources produced by agriculture equally distributed among the workers or is there a strong bias in favour of companies?
- Based on the CO2 emission and the use of pesticides, what is the environmental impact of agriculture on the producing countries and on the importing countries?
- What are the consequences of the agriculture industry on the availibility of natural and energetic resources?
- What are the differences among nations and products? Is there any similar pattern in the poor and rich nations?
- Once all these questions have been answered, could any of these issues be a possible concurrent cause for world hunger? How could these be possibly solved?

# Dataset
We plan to use at least part of the many datasets provided by FAOSTAT. They consist on time-series and cross-sectional data about worldwide food production and agriculture-related topics: trade and food balance, emissions, agri-environmental indicators, land use.
Datasets are available for download on Kaggle or directly on FAO website (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), are provided in csv format and apper to be already well formatted: grouping, selecting and other basic operations should be straightforward. Morover, since the amount of data is conveniently split in different files, which individually do not usually exceed 200-300 MB, the project should be manageable without the support of a remote cluster.
Accessory data about demographic or economic aspects which may turn out to be useful during project development could be easily retrieved from main international institutions websites, for example:
- United Nations http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx;
- World Bank https://data.worldbank.org/.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Setup the project: November 4

    According to TA's answers, discuss the feasibility of the project and possibile changes.
    
    Define the precise targets of the project: what do we want as a final result?

    Find out how to clean and divide the data, assigning tasks to each member of the group.

    Discuss a way to put the results together.

- Let's start working! : November 11

    Start working on the project in parallel.

    Keep updating the group on individual results and try to merge them.

- Finish Processing & Analyzing: November 18

    Finish all the divided tasks and start merging all the work.
    
    Discuss the results and keep working on the project.

- The Report: November 25

    Clean and well explain the code.
    
    Start writing the report.
    
    Any other business...
    
# Questions for TAs
- Is it a good and interesting idea?
- What should we change or improve?
- Is the aim of this project too complex or not feasible?
- The environmental impact could be also correlated to other agents that we are not considering: how to handle this problem?
