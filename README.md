# Title
A GORGEOUS PROJECT

# Abstract
Wealth inequality, global warming and natural resources exploitation are some of the most discussed issues of the last decades. In our project we want to assess the influence that agriculture and livestock farming have on these different topics and how these problems could be solved.  
The effect of agriculture will be evaluated by measuring the produced carbon dioxide, the use of pesticides, whether resources are equally distributed on the production chain and eventually how these affect the availability of natural resources. Both the influence of single products and single countries on these matters will be assessed. This will provide us insight on what nations play a key role in accumulating the agriculture-originated wealth of third countries. Hence, we will evaluate nations reciprocal influence. We will also try to comprehend how all these factors can be correlated to the world hunger and how the UN could try to alleviate the issue.

# Research questions
- Are the resources produced by agriculture equally distributed between the workers or is there a strong bias in favour of companies? What are the difference among nations and products? Why?
- Based on the CO2 emission and the use of pesticides, what is the environmental impact of agriculture on the producing countries and on the importing countries? What are the difference among nations and products? Why?
- What are consequences of the agriulture industry on the matter of the availibility of natural and energetic resources? What are the difference among nations and products? Why?
- Once all these questions have been answerd. Could any of these issues be the casue of world hunger? Why? How could this be possibly solved?
